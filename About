Who we are:
REdefine co. is a for-profit company run by Serenna Eason and Alerea Roberts. Our company is aiming to allow everyone the capability of protected, clear skin REdefining skincare to REdefine you.  

The problem we tackle:
Our issue is today's skincare is topical, not environmentally friendly and having to buy multiple products to solve one skin issue. Having to reapply sunscreen twice an hour and having a 10-step nightly skincare routine in hopes of achieving the perfect skin. Aiming to make the white cast from sunscreen and pimple patches a thing of the past. We want to target common skin issues such as acne, hyperpigmentation, and UV protection. 

What solutions we provide:
Our solution is to have an annual skincare injection that gives you the option of curating what problems you are targeting, whether it is a UV protectant for the daily sunscreen user, reversing the look of aging with our dark spot eraser, or eliminating all types of acne. We plan to take on the task of making a skincare and suncare line that can target individuals specific skincare problems or needs. We want our customers to feel good about what theyâ€™re investing their time and money in. Our goal is to make a mark on the skincare industry with our eco-conscious, affordable, and all around better products and practices to make having great skin accessible to all.
